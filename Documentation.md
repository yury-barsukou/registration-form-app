## setupTests.js

### Purpose

The `setupTests.js` file is used to configure and set up the testing environment for the application. It imports the necessary libraries and configurations required for testing React components using Jest and the React Testing Library.

### Core Logic

1. **Importing jest-dom**: The file imports `@testing-library/jest-dom`, which extends Jest with custom matchers for asserting on DOM nodes. This allows you to use matchers like `toHaveTextContent`, `toBeInTheDocument`, and more in your tests.

```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

### Usage Instructions

The `setupTests.js` file is automatically recognized by Jest when running tests. You do not need to import this file manually in your test files. Simply write your tests using Jest and the React Testing Library, and the configurations in `setupTests.js` will be applied automatically.

### Testing Guidelines

To ensure the testing environment is set up correctly, consider the following steps:

1. **Run Sample Tests**: Write and run a few sample tests to verify that the custom matchers from `jest-dom` are available and working as expected.
2. **Check Configuration**: Ensure that the `setupTests.js` file is located in the correct directory (`src/`) and that Jest is configured to recognize it.

By following these steps, you can confirm that the testing environment is properly configured and ready for writing and running tests.

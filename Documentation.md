## SignInForm Component

### Overview
The `SignInForm` component is a React functional component that provides a user interface for signing in. It includes fields for email and password, along with validation logic to ensure the inputs are correct before submission.

### Component Structure
- **State Variables**:
  - `signInData`: An object containing `email` and `password` fields.
  - `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the email input is valid.
  - `isSignInPasswordValid`: A boolean indicating whether the password input is valid.

- **Event Handlers**:
  - `handleSignInInputChange`: Handles changes to the input fields and updates the state accordingly. It also triggers validation for email and password.
  - `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
  - `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form is valid by ensuring all fields are filled and valid.
  - `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles the form submission. It prevents the default form submission behavior and logs the sign-in data if the form is valid.

- **JSX Structure**:
  - A form with `id="mycompany-login-form"`.
  - Two input fields for email and password.
  - Validation messages for email and password.
  - A "Forgot Password?" link.
  - A submit button that is disabled if the form is not valid.

### Important Information for Testing

#### Endpoints
- No specific endpoints are defined in this component. However, the form submission logic should eventually send data to a server endpoint.

#### Validation Logic
- **Email Validation**: Uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
- **Password Validation**: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.

#### Testing Scenarios
##### Positive Cases
1. **Valid Email and Password**:
   - Input a valid email (e.g., `test@example.com`) and a valid password (e.g., `password123`).
   - Ensure the form submits successfully.

##### Negative Cases
1. **Invalid Email**:
   - Input an invalid email (e.g., `invalid-email`).
   - Ensure the email validation message is displayed.
   - Ensure the submit button is disabled.

2. **Invalid Password**:
   - Input a password with less than 8 characters (e.g., `pass`).
   - Ensure the password validation message is displayed.
   - Ensure the submit button is disabled.

##### Edge Cases
1. **Empty Fields**:
   - Leave both email and password fields empty.
   - Ensure the submit button is disabled.

2. **Boundary Values**:
   - Input a password with exactly 8 characters (e.g., `password`).
   - Ensure the form submits successfully.

### Technical Debt
- **Code Structure**: The component is well-structured, but the validation logic can be extracted into separate utility functions for better readability and reusability.
- **Security Vulnerability**: Ensure that the form submission logic includes proper sanitization and validation on the server-side to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
- **Code Smells**: No significant code smells detected.
- **Code Style**: The code follows standard React and JavaScript conventions.

## SignInForm.js Documentation

### Overview

The `SignInForm.js` file contains a React component for a sign-in form. This form includes fields for email and password, along with validation logic for both fields. The form also includes a "Forgot Password?" link and a submit button that is disabled until the form is valid.

### Component: SignInForm

#### State Variables

- `signInData`: An object containing the email and password entered by the user.
- `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered email is valid.
- `isSignInPasswordValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered password meets the minimum length requirement (8 characters).

#### Functions

- `handleSignInInputChange(e)`: Updates the state with the user's input and validates the email and password fields.
- `validateEmail(email)`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
- `isSignInFormValid()`: Checks if the form is valid by ensuring that the email and password fields are filled out and valid.
- `handleSignInSubmit(e)`: Handles the form submission. If the form is valid, it logs the sign-in data to the console.

#### JSX Structure

- `<form>`: The main form element with an ID of `mycompany-login-form`.
  - `<div className="inner-form-wrapper">`: Wrapper for the form content.
    - `<div className="input-group">`: Group for the email input field.
      - `<label htmlFor="company_email_login">`: Label for the email input.
      - `<input type="email" id="company_email_login" ... />`: Email input field.
      - `<div className="email-validation-message invalid">`: Validation message for the email field (conditionally rendered).
    - `<div className="input-group">`: Group for the password input field.
      - `<label htmlFor="company_pass_login">`: Label for the password input.
      - `<input type="password" id="company_pass_login" ... />`: Password input field.
      - `<div className="password-validation-message invalid">`: Validation message for the password field (conditionally rendered).
    - `<div className="forgot-password">`: "Forgot Password?" link.
    - `<div className="space-above-large">`: Wrapper for the submit button.
      - `<button id="sign_in_btn" ... >`: Submit button (conditionally disabled based on form validity).

### Important Information for Testing

#### Endpoints
- No specific endpoints are mentioned in the code. The form submission logic should be extended to include an endpoint for handling sign-in requests.

#### Validation Logic
- Email validation using a regular expression.
- Password validation to ensure a minimum length of 8 characters.

#### Testing Scenarios

##### Positive Cases
1. Enter a valid email and a password with at least 8 characters, then submit the form. Ensure the form submits successfully.
2. Verify that the submit button is enabled when the form is valid.

##### Negative Cases
1. Enter an invalid email and a valid password, then submit the form. Ensure the form does not submit and the email validation message is displayed.
2. Enter a valid email and a password with less than 8 characters, then submit the form. Ensure the form does not submit and the password validation message is displayed.

##### Edge Cases
1. Test with an empty email and password field. Ensure the form does not submit and both validation messages are displayed.
2. Test with an email containing special characters and a valid password. Ensure the form submits successfully if the email is valid.

#### Boundary Values
1. Test with a password of exactly 8 characters. Ensure the form submits successfully.
2. Test with a password of 7 characters. Ensure the form does not submit and the password validation message is displayed.

### Technical Debt

#### Code Structure
- The code structure is clean and follows React best practices. However, consider extracting the validation logic into separate utility functions for better readability and reusability.

#### Code Optimizations
- None identified.

#### Security Vulnerabilities
- Ensure that the form submission logic includes proper sanitization and validation on the server side to prevent SQL injection and other security threats.

#### Code Smells
- None identified.

#### Code Style Issues
- None identified.

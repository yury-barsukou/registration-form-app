# Documentation for SignInForm.js

## Overview
The `SignInForm.js` file implements a sign-in form component using React. This form allows users to input their email and password, validates these inputs, and handles the form submission.

## Technical Documentation

### Components and Functions

- **State Variables:**
  - `signInData`: An object holding the email and password entered by the user.
  - `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered email is valid.
  - `isSignInPasswordValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered password meets the required length.

- **Functions:**
  - `handleSignInInputChange`: Updates the state with the user input and triggers validation for email and password.
  - `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
  - `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form data is valid.
  - `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles the form submission if the form data is valid.

### Core Logic

1. **State Management:** The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage the form data and validation states.
2. **Input Handling:** The `handleSignInInputChange` function updates the state with the user's input and validates the email and password.
3. **Validation:**
   - Email validation is performed using a regular expression in the `validateEmail` function.
   - Password validation checks if the password length is at least 8 characters.
4. **Form Submission:** The `handleSignInSubmit` function prevents the default form submission behavior and logs the form data if the form is valid.

       </div>
     );
   }

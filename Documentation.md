# SignInForm Component Documentation

## Overview
The `SignInForm` component is a React functional component that provides a sign-in form for users. It includes fields for email and password, with validation for both. The form ensures that the email is in a valid format and the password meets a minimum length requirement before allowing submission.

## Component Structure
- **State Variables:**
  - `signInData`: An object holding the email and password input values.
  - `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered email is valid.
  - `isSignInPasswordValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered password meets the minimum length requirement.

- **Functions:**
  - `handleSignInInputChange`: Handles changes to the input fields and updates the state accordingly. It also triggers validation for email and password.
  - `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
  - `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form is valid by ensuring both email and password are valid.
  - `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles form submission, preventing the default form submission behavior and logging the sign-in data if the form is valid.

## JSX Structure

  - `id`: `mycompany-login-form`
  - `onSubmit`: `handleSignInSubmit`

    - `autoComplete`: `email`
    - `value`: `signInData.email`
    - `onChange`: `handleSignInInputChange`
  - **Validation Message:** Displayed if `isEmailValid` is `false`.

- **Password Input Group:**
  - `label`: "Password"
  - `input`:
    - `type`: `password`
    - `id`: `company_pass_login`
    - `className`: `form-control`
    - `name`: `password`
    - `autoComplete`: `current-password`
    - `value`: `signInData.password`
    - `onChange`: `handleSignInInputChange`
  - **Validation Message:** Displayed if `isSignInPasswordValid` is `false`.

- **Forgot Password Link:**
  - `href`: `#`
  - `tabIndex`: `0`

- **Submit Button:**
  - `id`: `sign_in_btn`
  - `className`: `next-button btn-new btn-large ${isSignInFormValid() ? '' : 'btn-disabled'}`
  - `disabled`: `!isSignInFormValid()`
  - `type`: `submit`
  - **Text:** "Sign In"

## Important Information for Testing
### Endpoints
- No specific endpoints are defined in this component. However, the form submission logic (`handleSignInSubmit`) should be extended to include an endpoint for actual sign-in functionality.

### Validation Logic
- **Email Validation:**
  - Uses a regular expression to ensure the email format is valid.
  - Displays a validation message if the email is invalid.
- **Password Validation:**
  - Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
  - Displays a validation message if the password is too short.

### Testing Scenarios
#### Positive Cases
- Valid email and password (at least 8 characters) should enable the submit button and allow form submission.
- Ensure that the form submission logs the correct sign-in data.

#### Negative Cases
- Invalid email format should display a validation message and disable the submit button.
- Password shorter than 8 characters should display a validation message and disable the submit button.

#### Edge Cases
- Empty email and password fields should disable the submit button.
- Test email validation with various edge cases (e.g., missing domain, special characters).
- Test password validation with exactly 8 characters and just below the limit.

### Boundary Values
- Email validation with the minimum and maximum length of valid email addresses.
- Password validation with exactly 8 characters and just below the limit (7 characters).

## Technical Debt
### Code Structure
- Consider extracting the validation logic into separate utility functions for better readability and reusability.
- The form submission logic should be extended to include actual sign-in functionality, such as sending data to a server.

### Security Vulnerabilities
- Ensure that the email and password fields are properly sanitized before sending to the server to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement proper error handling for form submission failures.

### Code Style Issues
- The inline validation messages and button classes can be refactored for better readability.
- Consider using a more descriptive name for the `signInData` state variable, such as `formData`.

## SignUpForm Component

### Overview
The `SignUpForm` component is a React functional component that provides a user interface for signing up new users. It includes fields for first name, last name, email, and password, along with validation logic for the email and password fields.

### Component Structure
- **State Variables:**
  - `formData`: An object containing the user's input for first name, last name, email, and password.
  - `passwordValidations`: An object containing boolean values indicating whether the password meets certain criteria (uppercase, lowercase, number, minimum length).
  - `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the email input is valid.

- **Event Handlers:**
  - `handleInputChange`: Updates the state variables based on user input and triggers validation functions for email and password.
  - `validatePassword`: Validates the password based on predefined criteria.
  - `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
  - `isFormValid`: Checks if all form fields are valid.
  - `handleSubmit`: Handles form submission, logging the form data if valid, or logging an error if invalid.

- **JSX Structure:**
  - A form element containing input fields for first name, last name, email, and password.
  - Validation messages for email and password.
  - A submit button that is enabled only if the form is valid.

### Important Information for Testing

#### Endpoints
- There are no specific endpoints in this component as it currently logs the form data to the console upon submission. In a real-world scenario, you would typically send the data to a server endpoint.

#### Validation Logic
- **Email Validation:**
  - Uses a regular expression to check if the email format is valid.
  - Displays an error message if the email is invalid.

- **Password Validation:**
  - Checks for at least one uppercase character.
  - Checks for at least one lowercase character.
  - Checks for at least one number.
  - Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long.
  - Displays validation messages that change color based on whether the criteria are met.

#### Testing Scenarios
- **Positive Cases:**
  - Valid first name, last name, email, and password that meets all criteria.
  - Form submission with valid data.

- **Negative Cases:**
  - Invalid email format.
  - Password missing one or more criteria (uppercase, lowercase, number, minimum length).
  - Empty first name or last name fields.
  - Form submission with invalid data.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - Email with special characters.
  - Password exactly 8 characters long.
  - Password with only one type of character (e.g., all uppercase or all numbers).
  - Rapid input changes to test real-time validation.

#### Boundary Values
- Email with the minimum and maximum length allowed by the regular expression.
- Password with exactly 8 characters and just below/above 8 characters.

### Technical Debt
- **Code Structure:**
  - The component is well-structured with clear separation of concerns between state management, validation logic, and rendering.
  - Consider extracting validation logic into separate utility functions for better reusability and testability.

- **Code Optimizations:**
  - Debounce the email and password validation to improve performance for rapid input changes.
  - Use a form library like Formik or React Hook Form for more scalable form handling.

- **Security Vulnerabilities:**
  - Ensure that the form data is sanitized before sending it to the server to prevent injection attacks.
  - Implement client-side and server-side validation for better security.

- **Code Smells and Style Issues:**
  - The component follows good coding practices with meaningful variable names and clear logic.
  - Consider adding PropTypes for better type checking and documentation.

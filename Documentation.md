## SignInForm.js

### Purpose

The `SignInForm.js` file contains a React component that renders a sign-in form for users to log in to the application. The form includes fields for email and password, and it performs validation on these inputs before allowing submission.

### Architecture

The component uses React's functional component syntax along with the `useState` hook to manage the form's state. The form's state includes the email and password entered by the user, as well as validation flags for these inputs.

### Core Logic

1. **State Management**: The component maintains the state for the email and password inputs using the `useState` hook. It also maintains validation states for the email and password.
2. **Input Handling**: The `handleSignInInputChange` function updates the state based on user input and triggers validation functions for the email and password fields.
3. **Email Validation**: The `validateEmail` function uses a regular expression to check if the entered email is in a valid format.
4. **Form Validation**: The `isSignInFormValid` function checks if both the email and password are valid before allowing form submission.
5. **Form Submission**: The `handleSignInSubmit` function handles the form submission event, preventing the default form submission behavior and logging the form data if the form is valid.

### Key Algorithms and Design Patterns

- **Regular Expression for Email Validation**: The component uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The component conditionally renders validation messages and disables the submit button based on the validity of the form inputs.

### Usage Instructions

To use the `SignInForm` component, import it into your React application and include it in your JSX as follows:

```jsx
import SignInForm from './SignInForm';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <SignInForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the `SignInForm` component in a React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import SignInForm from './SignInForm';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <SignInForm />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Testing Guidelines

To test the `SignInForm` component, consider the following test cases and edge cases:

1. **Valid Email and Password**: Ensure that the form submits successfully when a valid email and password are entered.
2. **Invalid Email**: Ensure that the form displays an error message when an invalid email is entered.
3. **Short Password**: Ensure that the form displays an error message when the password is shorter than 8 characters.
4. **Empty Fields**: Ensure that the form does not submit when either the email or password field is empty.
5. **Forgot Password Link**: Ensure that the

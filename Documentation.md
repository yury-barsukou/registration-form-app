## index.css

### Purpose

The `index.css` file contains the global CSS styles for the application. It sets the default styles for the `body` and `code` elements to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.

### Architecture

The file defines two main CSS rules:
1. **Body Styles**: Sets the margin to 0, applies a system font stack for better font rendering across different platforms, and enables font smoothing for better text rendering.
2. **Code Styles**: Sets a monospaced font stack for code elements to ensure that code snippets are displayed in a consistent and readable manner.

### Core Logic

1. **Body Styles**:
   - `margin: 0;`: Removes the default margin from the body element.
   - `font-family`: Applies a system font stack to ensure that the text is rendered using the best available font on the user's system.
   - `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;`: Enables font smoothing for better text rendering on WebKit-based browsers.
   - `-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;`: Enables font smoothing for better text rendering on macOS.

2. **Code Styles**:
   - `font-family`: Applies a monospaced font stack to ensure that code snippets are displayed in a consistent and readable manner.

### Usage Instructions

To use the styles defined in `index.css`, simply import the file into your main JavaScript or TypeScript file (e.g., `index.js` or `index.tsx`) as follows:

```javascript
import './index.css';
```

This will apply the global styles to your application.

### Testing Guidelines

Since `index.css` contains global styles, testing should focus on ensuring that these styles are applied correctly across the application. Consider the following test cases:

1. **Body Margin**: Verify that the body element has no margin.
2. **Font Family**: Verify that the text is rendered using the system font stack.
3. **Font Smoothing**: Verify that font smoothing is enabled on WebKit-based browsers and macOS.
4. **Code Font Family**: Verify that code snippets are displayed using the monospaced font stack.

### Aggregated Testing Guidelines

To test the components and styles in the application, consider the following test cases and edge cases:

1. **Valid Form Submission**: Ensure that forms submit successfully when all fields are filled out correctly and the inputs are valid.
2. **Invalid Email**: Ensure that forms display an error message when an invalid email is entered.
3. **Password Criteria**: Ensure that forms display error messages when the password does not meet the required criteria (uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and minimum length of 8 characters).
4. **Empty Fields**: Ensure that forms do not submit when any of the required fields are empty.
5. **Real-time Validation**: Ensure that validation messages update in real-time as the user types in the input fields.
6. **Body Margin**: Verify that the body element has no margin.
7. **Font Family**: Verify that the text is rendered using the system font stack.
8. **Font Smoothing**: Verify that font smoothing is enabled on WebKit-based browsers and macOS.
9. **Code Font Family**: Verify that code snippets are displayed using the monospaced font stack.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that the components and styles in your application are functioning correctly and providing a consistent user experience.

## SignUpForm.js

### Purpose

The `SignUpForm.js` file contains a React component that renders a sign-up form for users to create a new account. The form includes fields for first name, last name, email, and password, and it performs validation on these inputs before allowing submission.

### Architecture

The component uses React's functional component syntax along with the `useState` hook to manage the form's state. The form's state includes the user's first name, last name, email, and password, as well as validation flags for the email and password.

### Core Logic

1. **State Management**: The component maintains the state for the form inputs using the `useState` hook. It also maintains validation states for the email and password.
2. **Input Handling**: The `handleInputChange` function updates the state based on user input and triggers validation functions for the email and password fields.
3. **Password Validation**: The `validatePassword` function checks if the entered password meets the required criteria (uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and minimum length of 8 characters).
4. **Email Validation**: The `validateEmail` function uses a regular expression to check if the entered email is in a valid format.
5. **Form Validation**: The `isFormValid` function checks if all form fields are filled out correctly and if the email and password are valid before allowing form submission.
6. **Form Submission**: The `handleSubmit` function handles the form submission event, preventing the default form submission behavior and logging the form data if the form is valid.

### Key Algorithms and Design Patterns

- **Regular Expression for Email Validation**: The component uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The component conditionally renders validation messages and disables the submit button based on the validity of the form inputs.

### Usage Instructions

To use the `SignUpForm` component, import it into your React application and include it in your JSX as follows:

```jsx
import SignUpForm from './SignUpForm';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <SignUpForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the `SignUpForm` component in a React application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import SignUpForm from './SignUpForm';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <SignUpForm />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Testing Guidelines

To test the `SignUpForm` component, consider the following test cases and edge cases:

1. **Valid Form Submission**: Ensure that the form submits successfully when all fields are filled out correctly and the email and password are valid.
2. **Invalid Email**: Ensure that the form displays an error message when an invalid email is entered.
3. **Password Criteria**: Ensure that the form displays error messages when the password does not meet the required criteria (uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and minimum length of 8 characters).
4. **Empty Fields**: Ensure that the form does not submit when any of the fields (first name, last name, email, or password) are empty.
5. **Real-time Validation**: Ensure that the validation messages update in real-time as the user types in the email and password fields.

## SignInForm.js

### Purpose

The `SignInForm.js` file contains a React component that renders a sign-in form for users to log in to the application. The form includes fields for email and password, and it performs validation on these inputs before allowing submission.

### Architecture

The component uses React's functional component syntax along with the `useState` hook to manage the form's state. The form's state includes the email and password entered by the user, as well as validation flags for these inputs.

### Core Logic

1. **State Management**: The component maintains the state for the email and password inputs using the `useState` hook. It also maintains validation states for the email and password.
2. **Input Handling**: The `handleSignInInputChange` function updates the state based on user input and triggers validation functions for the email and password fields.
3. **Email Validation**: The `validateEmail` function uses a regular expression to check if the entered email is in a valid format.
4. **Form Validation**: The `isSignInFormValid` function checks if both the email and password are valid before allowing form submission.
5. **Form Submission**: The `handleSignInSubmit` function handles the form submission event, preventing the default form submission behavior and logging the form data if the form is valid.

### Key Algorithms and Design Patterns

- **Regular Expression for Email Validation**: The component uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The component conditionally renders validation messages and disables the submit button based on the validity of the form inputs.

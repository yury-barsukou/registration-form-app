## package.json

### Technical Documentation

The `package.json` file is a crucial component of any Node.js project. It contains metadata relevant to the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.

**File Structure:**
- **name**: The name of the project.
- **version**: The current version of the project.
- **private**: A boolean indicating if the project is private.
- **dependencies**: Lists the project's runtime dependencies.
- **scripts**: Defines a set of commands that can be run using `npm run`.
- **jest**: Configuration for Jest, a JavaScript testing framework.
- **eslintConfig**: Configuration for ESLint, a static code analysis tool.
- **browserslist**: Specifies the target browsers for the project.

**Core Logic:**
- **Dependencies**: The file lists several dependencies required for the project, including React, React DOM, and various testing libraries.
- **Scripts**: Commonly used scripts include:
  - `start`: Starts the development server.
  - `build`: Builds the project for production.
  - `test`: Runs the test suite.
  - `eject`: Ejects the configuration files from `react-scripts`.

### User Guide

**How to Use:**
1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. **Start Development Server**: Use `npm start` to start the development server.
3. **Build Project**: Use `npm run build` to build the project for production.
4. **Run Tests**: Use `npm test` to run the test suite with coverage.
5. **Eject Configuration**: Use `npm run eject` to eject the configuration files if you need to customize the setup.

**Examples:**
- To start the development server, run:
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
- To build the project, run:
  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
- To run tests, run:

  npm test
  ```

### Testing Checklist

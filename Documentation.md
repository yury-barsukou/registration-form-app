## SignInForm.js

### Technical Documentation

**Purpose:**
The `SignInForm.js` file contains a React component that renders a sign-in form for users to log into the application. It includes form validation for email and password fields.

**Architecture:**
- **State Management:** Uses React's `useState` hook to manage form data and validation states.
- **Validation:** Email validation is performed using a regular expression. Password validation checks for a minimum length of 8 characters.
- **Form Submission:** The form submission is handled by the `handleSignInSubmit` function, which currently logs the form data to the console.

**Core Logic:**
- `handleSignInInputChange`: Updates the state with the input values and triggers validation.
- `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
- `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form is valid based on the current state.
- `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles the form submission event.

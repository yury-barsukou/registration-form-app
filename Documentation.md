## SignInForm.js

### Technical Documentation

**Purpose:**
The `SignInForm.js` file contains a React component that renders a sign-in form for users to log into the application. It includes form validation for email and password fields.

**Architecture:**
- **State Management:** Uses React's `useState` hook to manage form data and validation states.
- **Validation:** Email validation is performed using a regular expression. Password validation checks for a minimum length of 8 characters.
- **Form Submission:** The form submission is handled by the `handleSignInSubmit` function, which currently logs the form data to the console.

**Core Logic:**
- `handleSignInInputChange`: Updates the state with the input values and triggers validation.
- `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
- `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form is valid based on the current state.
- `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles the form submission event.

### Functional User Guide

1. **Email Input:**
   - Enter a valid email address in the email input field.
   - If the email is invalid, an error message will be displayed.
2. **Password Input:**
   - Enter a password with at least 8 characters.
   - If the password is too short, an error message will be displayed.
3. **Form Submission:**
   - Click the "Sign In" button to submit the form.
   - The button will be disabled if the form is invalid.

### Testing Checklist

- **Email Validation:**
  - Test with a valid email address.
  - Test with an invalid email address (e.g., missing '@' or domain).
- **Password Validation:**
  - Test with a password that is at least 8 characters long.
  - Test with a password that is shorter than 8 characters.
- **Form Submission:**
  - Test form submission with valid data.
  - Test form submission with invalid data (e.g., invalid email or short password).
- **UI Elements:**
  - Ensure the error messages are displayed correctly for invalid inputs.
  - Ensure the submit button is enabled/disabled based on form validity.

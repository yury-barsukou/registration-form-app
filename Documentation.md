## SignInForm.js

### Technical Documentation

**Purpose:**
The `SignInForm.js` file implements a sign-in form component using React. It allows users to input their email and password to sign in.

**Architecture:**
- The component uses React functional components and hooks (`useState`) to manage state.
- The form includes input fields for email and password, with validation for both fields.
- The form submission is handled by the `handleSignInSubmit` function, which currently logs the sign-in data to the console.

**Core Logic:**
- `useState` is used to manage the state of the sign-in data (`signInData`), email validation (`isEmailValid`), and password validation (`isSignInPasswordValid`).
- `handleSignInInputChange` updates the state based on user input and triggers validation functions.
- `validateEmail` checks if the email input matches a regular expression pattern for valid email addresses.
- `isSignInFormValid` checks if both email and password inputs are valid.
- `handleSignInSubmit` prevents the default form submission behavior and logs the sign-in data if the form is valid.

### Functional User Guide

1. **Email Input:**
   - Enter a valid email address in the email input field.
   - If the email is invalid, an error message will be displayed below the input field.

2. **Password Input:**
   - Enter a password with at least 8 characters in the password input field.
   - If the password is invalid, an error message will be displayed below the input field.

3. **Form Submission:**
   - Click the 'Sign In' button to submit the form.
   - The button will be disabled if the email or password inputs are invalid.
   - On successful submission, the sign-in data will be logged to the console.

### Testing Checklist

- **Email Validation:**
  - Test with valid email addresses (e.g., `user@example.com`).
  - Test with invalid email addresses (e.g., `user@com`, `user@.com`).
  - Ensure the error message is displayed for invalid emails.

- **Password Validation:**
  - Test with passwords of various lengths (e.g., less than 8 characters, 8 or more characters).
  - Ensure the error message is displayed for passwords with less than 8 characters.

- **Form Submission:**
  - Test form submission with valid email and password.
  - Test form submission with invalid email and/or password.
  - Ensure the 'Sign In' button is disabled when the form is invalid.
  - Verify that the sign-in data is logged to the console on successful submission.

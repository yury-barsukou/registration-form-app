# Documentation for SignInForm Component

## Technical Documentation

**Purpose:**
The `SignInForm.js` file implements a sign-in form component using React. This component allows users to input their email and password to sign in. It includes validation for the email format and password length.

**Architecture:**
- **State Management:** The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage the state of the sign-in form data (`signInData`), email validation (`isEmailValid`), and password validation (`isSignInPasswordValid`).
- **Event Handlers:** 
  - `handleSignInInputChange`: Updates the state when the user types in the email or password fields and triggers validation.
  - `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
  - `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form is valid based on the email and password validation states.
  - `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles the form submission, preventing the default form submission behavior and logging the sign-in data if the form is valid.

**Core Logic:**
- **Email Validation:** Uses a regular expression to ensure the email format is correct.
- **Password Validation:** Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
- **Form Submission:** The submit button is disabled if the form is invalid, preventing submission.

## User Guide

**How to Use:**
1. **Render the Component:**
   - Import and include the `SignInForm` component in your React application.
   ```jsx
   import SignInForm from './SignInForm';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <SignInForm />
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

2. **Fill in the Form:**
   - Enter a valid email address in the email field.
   - Enter a password with at least 8 characters in the password field.

3. **Submit the Form:**
   - Click the "Sign In" button to submit the form.
   - If the form is valid, the sign-in data will be logged to the console.

**Example:**
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import SignInForm from './SignInForm';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <SignInForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Testing Checklist

**Functional Testing:**
- **Email Field:**
  - Test with a valid email format (e.g., `user@example.com`).
  - Test with an invalid email format (e.g., `user@com`, `user@.com`).
  - Verify that the validation message appears for invalid email formats.

- **Password Field:**
  - Test with a password of fewer than 8 characters.
  - Test with a password of 8 or more characters.
  - Verify that the validation message appears for passwords with fewer than 8 characters.

- **Form Submission:**
  - Test form submission with valid email and password.
  - Test form submission with invalid email and/or password.
  - Verify that the submit button is disabled for invalid form data.
  - Verify that the sign-in data is logged to the console for valid form submissions.

**Edge Cases:**
- Test with empty email and password fields.
- Test with leading/trailing spaces in email and password fields.
- Test rapid input changes to ensure state updates correctly.

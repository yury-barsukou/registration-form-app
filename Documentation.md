## package.json

### Overview
The `package.json` file is a crucial component of any Node.js project. It contains metadata relevant to the project and is used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version, and other configurations. This file is essential for both development and production environments.

### File Structure
- **name**: The name of the project.
- **version**: The current version of the project.
- **private**: A boolean indicating if the project is private. If true, it prevents the project from being accidentally published to the npm registry.
- **dependencies**: Lists the packages required by the project to run.
- **scripts**: Defines a set of commands that can be run using `npm run <script-name>`.
- **jest**: Configuration for the Jest testing framework.
- **eslintConfig**: Configuration for ESLint, a tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **browserslist**: Specifies the target browsers for the project.

### Dependencies
The `dependencies` section lists the libraries and frameworks that the project depends on:
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Custom jest matchers to test the state of the DOM.
- `@testing-library/react`: Simple and complete React DOM testing utilities.
- `@testing-library/user-event`: Fire events the same way the user does.
- `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `react-dom`: Serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React.
- `react-scripts`: Scripts and configuration used by Create React App.
- `web-vitals`: A library for measuring the quality of user experience on the web.

### Scripts
The `scripts` section defines various commands that can be run to manage the project:
- `start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `build`: Builds the app for production.
- `test`: Runs the test suite with coverage.
- `eject`: Removes the single build dependency from the project.

### Jest Configuration
The `jest` section configures the Jest testing framework:
- `collectCoverageFrom`: Specifies the files for which coverage information should be collected.

### ESLint Configuration
The `eslintConfig` section configures ESLint:
- `extends`: Specifies the ESLint configurations to extend.

### Browserslist Configuration
The `browserslist` section specifies the target browsers for the project:
- `production`: Browsers for the production environment.
- `development`: Browsers for the development environment.

## Functional User Guide

### How to Use the Scripts
1. **Start the Development Server**
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
   This command starts the development server and opens the app in the default web browser.

2. **Build the Project**
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

3. **Run Tests**
   ```sh
   npm run test
   ```
   This command runs the test suite and generates a coverage report.

4. **Eject the Configuration**
   ```sh
   npm run eject
   ```
   This command removes the single build dependency from the project. **Note**: This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.

## Testing Checklist

1. **Dependency Installation**
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed by running `npm install`.

2. **Development Server**
   - Verify that the development server starts correctly with `npm run start`.
   - Check that the application loads in the browser without errors.

3. **Build Process**
   - Confirm that the project builds successfully with `npm run build`.
   - Ensure the build output is correct and optimized.

4. **Testing**
   - Run the test suite using `npm run test`.
   - Verify that all tests pass and coverage is reported correctly.
   - Check that the coverage report includes the expected files and excludes the specified files.

5. **Linting**
   - Ensure that ESLint is correctly configured and runs without errors.
   - Verify that the code adheres to the specified linting rules.

6. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Confirm that the application works in the browsers specified in the `browserslist` configuration.

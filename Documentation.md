## SignUpForm Component

### Overview
The `SignUpForm` component is a React functional component that renders a user registration form. It includes fields for first name, last name, email, and password. The component validates the email and password fields and ensures that all fields are filled out before allowing the form to be submitted.

### Component Structure

#### State Variables
- `formData`: An object containing the form fields (`firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `password`).
- `passwordValidations`: An object containing the validation status of the password (`hasUppercase`, `hasLowercase`, `hasNumber`, `isLongEnough`).
- `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the email is valid.

#### Functions
- `handleInputChange`: Updates the form data and triggers validation for the email and password fields.
- `validatePassword`: Validates the password based on the criteria (uppercase, lowercase, number, and minimum length).
- `validateEmail`: Validates the email using a regular expression.
- `isFormValid`: Checks if all form fields are filled and valid.
- `handleSubmit`: Handles form submission, logs the form data if valid, and prevents default form submission behavior.

#### Form Fields
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Password

#### Validation Messages
- Email validation message
- Password validation criteria (uppercase, lowercase, number, minimum length)

### Important Information for Testing

#### Endpoints
- No specific endpoints are used in this component. Form submission is logged to the console.

#### Specific Calculation/Validation Logic
- **Email Validation**: Uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
- **Password Validation**: Ensures the password contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and is at least 8 characters long.

#### Testing Scenarios

##### Positive Cases
1. **Valid Form Submission**: Fill out all fields with valid data and submit the form. Verify that the form data is logged to the console.
2. **Password Validation**: Enter a password that meets all criteria and verify that all validation messages turn green.

##### Negative Cases
1. **Empty Fields**: Attempt to submit the form with one or more empty fields. Verify that the form is not submitted and appropriate validation messages are shown.
2. **Invalid Email**: Enter an invalid email format and verify that the email validation message is displayed.
3. **Invalid Password**: Enter a password that does not meet one or more criteria and verify that the corresponding validation messages remain red.

##### Edge Cases
1. **Boundary Values for Password Length**: Enter a password with exactly 7 characters and verify that the minimum length validation message remains red. Enter a password with exactly 8 characters and verify that the message turns green.
2. **Special Characters in Email**: Test email validation with special characters and edge cases (e.g., `user@domain`, `user@domain.c`, `user@domain.co`, `user@domain.com`).

### Technical Debt

#### Code Structure
- Consider extracting validation logic into separate utility functions for better readability and reusability.
- The form submission logic can be extended to handle actual server requests.

#### Code Optimizations
- Use `useCallback` for `handleInputChange`, `validatePassword`, and `validateEmail` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Use a single state object for form data and validations to reduce the number of `useState` hooks.

#### Security Vulnerability
- Ensure that the form data is sanitized before sending it to the server to prevent XSS attacks.

#### Code Smells
- Inline styles for validation messages can be moved to a CSS file for better maintainability.

#### Code Style Issues
- Ensure consistent use of single quotes for strings.
- Add PropTypes for better type checking and documentation.

## SignInForm.js

### Overview
`SignInForm.js` is a React component that renders a sign-in form with email and password fields. It includes validation for both fields and provides feedback to the user if the input is invalid. The form submission is handled by a function that checks the validity of the input before proceeding.

### Component Structure
- **State Variables:**
  - `signInData`: An object containing `email` and `password` fields.
  - `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the email input is valid.
  - `isSignInPasswordValid`: A boolean indicating whether the password input is valid.

- **Functions:**
  - `handleSignInInputChange`: Updates the state with the input values and triggers validation.
  - `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
  - `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form is valid based on the state variables.
  - `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles form submission, preventing default behavior and logging the form data if valid.

- **JSX Structure:**
  - A form element with id `mycompany-login-form`.
  - Two input fields for email and password, each with associated labels and validation messages.
  - A "Forgot Password?" link.
  - A submit button that is disabled if the form is not valid.

### Important Information for Testing

#### Endpoints
- No specific endpoints are mentioned in the code. The form submission logic (`handleSignInSubmit`) currently logs the form data to the console. In a real application, this would likely involve sending a request to a server endpoint.

#### Validation Logic
- **Email Validation:**
  - Uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
  - Displays an error message if the email is invalid.
- **Password Validation:**
  - Checks if the password length is at least 8 characters.
  - Displays an error message if the password is too short.

#### Testing Scenarios
1. **Positive Cases:**
   - Valid email and password (at least 8 characters).
   - Ensure the form submits successfully and the data is logged to the console.

2. **Negative Cases:**
   - Invalid email format.
   - Password less than 8 characters.
   - Ensure appropriate error messages are displayed and the form is not submitted.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Email with special characters.
   - Password exactly 8 characters long.
   - Empty email and password fields.
   - Ensure the form behaves correctly in these scenarios.

4. **Boundary Values:**
   - Email with the minimum valid length.
   - Password with exactly 8 characters.
   - Ensure the form validation logic correctly handles these boundary values.

#### Technical Debt and Code Quality
- **Code Structure:**
  - The code is well-structured and follows React best practices.
  - Consider separating validation logic into utility functions for better readability and reusability.

- **Code Optimizations:**
  - None identified.

- **Security Vulnerabilities:**
  - Ensure that the form submission logic includes proper sanitization and validation on the server side to prevent injection attacks.

- **Code Smells:**
  - None identified.

- **Code Style Issues:**
  - None identified.

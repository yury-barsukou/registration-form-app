## CSS Files

### `src/index.css`

#### Technical Documentation

**File Purpose:**
The `src/index.css` file is a CSS stylesheet that provides basic styling for the web application. It sets default styles for the `body` and `code` elements to ensure a consistent appearance across different browsers and platforms.

**Architecture and Core Logic:**
- **Global Styles:**
  - The `body` selector sets the margin to `0` and applies a default font stack that includes system fonts and common web fonts. This ensures that the text is rendered smoothly and consistently.
  - The `code` selector applies a monospace font stack to ensure that code snippets are displayed in a fixed-width font, which is essential for readability and alignment.

**CSS Rules:**
- `body`:
  - `margin: 0;`: Removes the default margin around the body element.
  - `font-family`: Sets a stack of fonts to ensure the text is rendered in a consistent and smooth manner.
  - `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;`: Improves the appearance of text in WebKit-based browsers.
  - `-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;`: Improves the appearance of text in Firefox on macOS.
- `code`:
  - `font-family`: Sets a stack of monospace fonts to ensure code snippets are displayed in a fixed-width font.

#### Functional User Guide

**How to Use:**
1. **Include the CSS File:**
   - Ensure that the `src/index.css` file is linked in the HTML file of your web application. This can be done by adding the following line within the `<head>` section of your HTML file:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/index.css">
     ```

2. **Body Styling:**
   - The `body` element will automatically have no margin and will use the specified font stack. This ensures that the entire viewport is utilized and the text is rendered smoothly.

3. **Code Styling:**
   - Any `<code>` elements within your HTML will automatically use the specified monospace font stack. This ensures that code snippets are displayed in a readable and aligned manner.

**Example:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="src/index.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a sample paragraph.</p>
  <code>console.log('Hello, World!');</code>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Testing Checklist

- **Body Element:**
  - Verify that the body element has no margin.
  - Check that the text within the body element uses the specified font stack.
  - Ensure that text rendering is smooth in WebKit-based browsers and Firefox on macOS.

- **Code Element:**
  - Verify that code snippets within `<code>` elements use the specified monospace font stack.
  - Check that the code snippets are displayed in a fixed-width font for readability and alignment.

- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**

  - Verify that the font smoothing properties work as expected in WebKit-based browsers and Firefox on macOS.

## SignInForm Component

### Overview
`SignInForm.js` is a React component that renders a sign-in form. It handles user input for email and password, and submits these credentials to a parent component via the `onSignIn` callback function.

### Components and Functions

1. **Imports**
   - `React, { useState } from 'react'`: Imports React and the `useState` hook for managing state within the component.
   - `./UserAuthForms.css`: Imports the CSS file for styling the form.

2. **SignInForm Component**
   - **Props**
     - `onSignIn`: A callback function passed as a prop to handle the sign-in action.
   - **State**
     - `email`: A state variable to store the user's email input.
     - `password`: A state variable to store the user's password input.
   - **Functions**
     - `handleSubmit(event)`: A function that prevents the default form submission behavior and calls the `onSignIn` function with the email and password.

3. **JSX Structure**
   - `<form>`: The main form element with a class name of `auth-form` and an `onSubmit` event handler.
   - `<h2>`: A heading for the form.
   - `<div className="form-group">`: A div containing a label and input for the email.
   - `<div className="form-group">`: A div containing a label and input for the password.
   - `<button>`: A submit button for the form.

### Example Usage
```jsx
<SignInForm onSignIn={(user) => console.log(user)} />
```

### Testing Information

#### Endpoints
- No specific endpoints are directly called in this component. It relies on the `onSignIn` prop to handle the sign-in logic.

#### Validation Logic
- The form validates that both email and password fields are filled before calling the `onSignIn` function.

#### Scenarios for Testing
1. **Positive Case:**
   - Enter a valid email and password.
   - Submit the form and ensure the `onSignIn` function is called with the correct email and password.

2. **Negative Case:**
   - Enter an invalid email or password.
   - Submit the form and ensure the `onSignIn` function is not called.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Test with an empty email field and ensure the form does not submit.
   - Test with an empty password field and ensure the form does not submit.

4. **Boundary Values:**
   - Test with the minimum and maximum length of email and password fields to ensure they are handled correctly.

#### Technical Debt
- **Code Structure:** The component is well-structured, but consider extracting the form groups into separate components for better reusability.
- **Code Optimization:** No significant optimization needed.
- **Security Vulnerability:** Ensure that the `onSignIn` function handles the email and password securely.
- **Code Smells:** No code smells detected.
- **Code Style Issues:** The code follows standard React and JavaScript conventions.

## SignInForm Component

### Overview

The `SignInForm` component is a React functional component that provides a user interface for signing in. It includes fields for email and password, and performs basic validation on these fields.

### Props

The `SignInForm` component does not accept any props.

### State

The component uses the following state variables:

- `signInData`: An object containing the email and password entered by the user.
- `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered email is valid.
- `isSignInPasswordValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered password meets the minimum length requirement.

### Methods

- `handleSignInInputChange`: Handles changes to the input fields and updates the state accordingly. It also triggers validation for the email and password fields.
- `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
- `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form is valid by ensuring that the email and password fields are not empty and meet their respective validation criteria.
- `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles the form submission. If the form is valid, it logs the sign-in data to the console (this is where you would typically handle the sign-in logic, such as sending the data to a server).

### JSX Structure

The component returns a form element with the following structure:

- A div with the class `inner-form-wrapper` containing:
  - An input group for the email field, including a label, input, and validation message.
  - An input group for the password field, including a label, input, and validation message.
  - A "Forgot Password?" link.
  - A submit button that is disabled if the form is not valid.

### CSS Classes

The component uses the following CSS classes:

- `inner-form-wrapper`: Wrapper for the form content.
- `input-group`: Wrapper for each input field and its label.
- `form-control`: Applied to the input fields.
- `email-validation-message`: Validation message for the email field.
- `password-validation-message`: Validation message for the password field.
- `forgot-password`: Wrapper for the "Forgot Password?" link.
- `space-above-large`: Adds space above the submit button.
- `next-button`, `btn-new`, `btn-large`, `btn-disabled`: Classes for styling the submit button.

### Example Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import SignInForm from './SignInForm';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <SignInForm />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Methods

### Dependencies

- `React`: The component relies on React for creating and managing the UI.
- `useState`: A React hook used for managing the component's state.
- `./UserAuthForms.css`: The component imports a CSS file for styling.

### Validation Logic

- **Email Validation**: The email is validated using a regular expression to ensure it follows a standard email format.
- **Password Validation**: The password must contain at least one uppercase character, one lowercase character, one number, and be at least 8 characters long.

### Accessibility

- The form includes labels for each input field to ensure accessibility for screen readers.
- The submit button is disabled when the form is invalid, preventing users from submitting incomplete or incorrect data.

### Potential Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling for form submission, such as displaying error messages when the server returns an error.
- **Styling**: Enhance the styling of the form to improve the user experience.
- **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests to ensure the component behaves as expected under various conditions.

## SignInForm.js

### Purpose

The `SignInForm.js` file contains a React component that renders a sign-in form. This form allows users to input their email and password to sign in. The component includes validation for the email format and password length.

### Architecture

The `SignInForm` component is a functional React component that uses the `useState` hook to manage form state and validation states. The component consists of the following key parts:

1. **State Management**: The component maintains the state for the form inputs (`email` and `password`) and their validation states (`isEmailValid` and `isSignInPasswordValid`).
2. **Event Handlers**: The component includes event handlers for input changes and form submission.
3. **Validation Functions**: The component includes functions to validate the email format and password length.
4. **Render Method**: The component renders the form with input fields, validation messages, and a submit button.

### Core Logic

1. **State Initialization**: The component initializes the state for `signInData`, `isEmailValid`, and `isSignInPasswordValid` using the `useState` hook.
2. **Input Change Handling**: The `handleSignInInputChange` function updates the state based on user input and triggers validation functions for email and password.
3. **Email Validation**: The `validateEmail` function uses a regular expression to check if the email format is valid and updates the `isEmailValid` state.
4. **Password Validation**: The password validation checks if the password length is at least 8 characters and updates the `isSignInPasswordValid` state.
5. **Form Validation**: The `isSignInFormValid` function checks if all form inputs are valid.
6. **Form Submission**: The `handleSignInSubmit` function handles form submission, preventing the default form submission behavior and logging the form data if the form is valid.

### Key Algorithms and Design Patterns

- **State Management**: The component uses the `useState` hook for managing form state and validation states.
- **Validation**: The component includes validation functions for email and password to ensure the form inputs meet the required criteria.
- **Conditional Rendering**: The component uses conditional rendering to display validation messages and enable/disable the submit button based on form validity.

### Usage Instructions

To use the `SignInForm` component, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Component**: Import the `SignInForm` component into your React application.

```javascript
import SignInForm from './path/to/SignInForm';
```

2. **Render the Component**: Render the `SignInForm` component in your application.

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <SignInForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

3. **Styling**: Ensure you have the necessary CSS styles for the form. The component imports styles from `UserAuthForms.css`.

### Testing Guidelines

To test the `SignInForm` component, consider the following test cases and edge cases:

1. **Valid Email and Password**: Test with a valid email format and a password with at least 8 characters. Ensure the form submits successfully.
2. **Invalid Email Format**: Test with an invalid email format and check if the email validation message is displayed.
3. **Short Password**: Test with a password shorter than 8 characters and check if the password validation message is displayed.
4. **Empty Fields**: Test with empty email and password fields and ensure the submit button is disabled.
5. **Forgot Password Link**: Test the

# SignInForm Component Documentation

## Overview
The `SignInForm` component is a React functional component that renders a sign-in form. It includes fields for email and password, and performs validation on these fields. The form submission is handled by the component, and it ensures that the form data is valid before allowing submission.

## Component Structure
- **State Variables:**
  - `signInData`: An object containing the email and password entered by the user.
  - `isEmailValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered email is valid.
  - `isSignInPasswordValid`: A boolean indicating whether the entered password meets the required criteria (minimum 8 characters).

- **Functions:**
  - `handleSignInInputChange`: Handles changes to the input fields and updates the state accordingly. It also triggers validation for the email and password fields.
  - `validateEmail`: Validates the email format using a regular expression.
  - `isSignInFormValid`: Checks if the form data is valid (both email and password).
  - `handleSignInSubmit`: Handles the form submission. It prevents the default form submission behavior and checks if the form data is valid before proceeding.

- **JSX Structure:**
  - The form includes two input fields for email and password.
  - Validation messages are displayed if the email or password is invalid.
  - A "Forgot Password?" link is provided.
  - The submit button is disabled if the form data is invalid.

## Important Information for Testing

### Endpoints
- There are no specific endpoints mentioned in the code. The form submission logic (e.g., sending data to a server) is not implemented and is represented by a console log statement.

### Validation Logic
- **Email Validation:**
  - The email is validated using a regular expression to check if it follows the standard email format.
  - If the email is invalid, an error message is displayed: "Please enter a valid email address".
- **Password Validation:**
  - The password must have at least 8 characters.
  - If the password is invalid, an error message is displayed: "Your password must have at least 8 characters".

### Testing Scenarios
- **Positive Cases:**
  - Enter a valid email and a password with at least 8 characters, and submit the form. Ensure that the form is submitted successfully.
- **Negative Cases:**
  - Enter an invalid email and a valid password, and submit the form. Ensure that the email validation message is displayed and the form is not submitted.
  - Enter a valid email and a password with less than 8 characters, and submit the form. Ensure that the password validation message is displayed and the form is not submitted.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Enter an empty email and password, and submit the form. Ensure that both validation messages are displayed and the form is not submitted.
  - Enter a valid email and a password with exactly 8 characters, and submit the form. Ensure that the form is submitted successfully.
  - Enter a valid email and a password with more than 8 characters, and submit the form. Ensure that the form is submitted successfully.

## Technical Debt
- **Code Structure:**
  - The code structure is generally good, but the validation logic could be extracted into separate utility functions for better readability and reusability.
- **Code Optimization:**
  - The `validateEmail` function could be memoized to avoid re-creating the regular expression on each call.
- **Security Vulnerability:**
  - The form submission logic should include proper error handling and security measures (e.g., sanitizing input data) when implemented.
- **Code Smells:**
  - The inline validation messages could be extracted into separate components for better readability.
- **Code Style Issues:**
  - The code follows a consistent style, but adding comments to explain the purpose of each function and state variable would improve readability.
